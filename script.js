    `Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed`,
    `My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard And they're like, it's better than yours Damn right it's better than yours`,
    `I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known Don't know where it goes But it's home to me, and I walk alone`,
    `No, I don't want no scrub A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride Tryin' to holla at me`,
    `I been tryin' to do it right I been livin' a lonely life I been sleepin' here instead I been sleepin' in my bed I been sleepin' in my bed`,
    `Stacy's mom has got it goin' on She's all I want And I've waited for so long Stacy, can't you see? You're just not the girl for me`,
    `Woah, we're half way there Woah, livin' on a prayer Take my hand, we'll make it I swear Woah, livin' on a prayer`,
    `You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep`,
    `I'm hooked on a feeling I'm high on believing That you're in love with me`,
    `If you like piÃ±a coladas And gettin' caught in the rain If you're not into yoga If you have half a brain If you like makin' love at midnight`,
    `Lean on me When you're not strong And I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on... For it won't be long Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on`,
    `Take me to your best friend's house Roll around this roundabout Oh yeah Take me to your best friend's house`,
    `Someone told me long ago There's a calm before the storm I know, it's been comin' for some time When it's over, so they say It'll rain a sunny day`,
    `Hey baby, won't you look my way? I can be your new addiction Hey baby, what you gotta say? All you're giving me is fiction`,
    `Hey, soul sister Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo The way you move ain't fair, you know`,
    `Hey there, Delilah What's it like in New York city? I'm a thousand miles away But, girl, tonight you look so pretty Yes, you do`,
    `I was scared of dentists and the dark I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations Oh, all my friends are turning green`,
    `Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted I fell right through the cracks Now I'm trying to get back`,
    `Big wheels keep on turnin' Carry me home to see my kin Singin' songs about the south-land I miss Alabamy once again and I think it's a sin, yes`,
    `Sweet Caroline Good times never seemed so good I've been inclined To believe they never would But now I`,
    `Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?`,
